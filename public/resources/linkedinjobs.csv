Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.



Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time.

Wefunder is like Robinhood for pre-IPO startups. We're the largest funding platform that helps normal people make investments in startups they love. Over the past few years, we've helped fund over 900 startups with $450M+ including flying cars, space rockets, breweries, Hollywood studios, and cancer cures.



We grew 4x year over year and tripled the size of our team in 2021. We’re looking for engineers who can help us wrangle complex systems and delight users along the way. As a Wefunder engineer, you'll have a tremendous amount of influence, ability to make a huge impact, and be expected to work on a little of everything. There's no red tape. It's a small team, and we move fast.



This posting covers engineers of all levels, including Junior, Senior, and beyond. We will prefer Junior Engineers with at least 1 year of professional experience. We expect everyone to contribute to the best of their knowledge and abilities, and those expectations will scale with your seniority level.



We're looking for frontend, full-stack, and backend engineers.



Location: Wefunder HQ is in San Francisco. We will generally prefer candidates who live in the SF Bay Area or want to relocate, but we're also open to fully-remote candidates who have a proven track record of working remotely effectively.



We will consider senior-level candidates requiring visa sponsorship.



What We're Looking For

 Experience working with complexity. Good code design in the right places is one of the best levers you have as an engineer. But bad design in the wrong places… ouch. Ability to deal with the chaos and ambiguity of a startup. Things change, surprises happen. There will be uncertainties in and out of our control. Our job is to ship product and keep the money flowing. Attention to detail. You can’t build a great product without being good about the details, whether it's behind the scenes or in the user’s face. We value UX and will go the extra mile to make our product easy, which usually makes implementation harder. You're excited to participate in code reviews for learning and ensuring code quality. You should be able to provide constructive feedback to your teammates — and receive it well. Senior Engineers who love to provide mentorship and help their teammates grow. Junior Engineers who can learn quickly.

Some Example Projects

 We're a full stack startup. Because of our need to control the user experience and keep our unit costs low, we're very vertically integrated. Some examples of projects you could be working on include... Fun banking software. We’ve built our own money management tools to handle $70M investments from 85k transactions. Securities regulations add extra fun. Our own version of Mattermark. We'll have thousands of companies fundraising on Wefunder, and we'll need algorithms to identify and curate the best ones. Tools for founders, e.g. built-in analytics. Our business grows whenever we make fundraising easier for founders. Why make them integrate Google Analytics when we can provide those insights by default?

Technical Requirements

 Expert in Ruby on Rails or similar toolset (like django or Node). We’re a Rails shop, but deep expertise in a web development framework speaks louder than rough familiarity with our preferred toolset. Expert in Javascript/CSS and experience with a framework like React. Experience with a relational SQL database. We use Postgres. Understanding of accessibility, SEO, responsive design, and website performance.

Brownie Points

 Experience with payments, security, or compliance-type problems. Scaled systems with 100k/1m/10m/100m/1b transactions. You enjoy customer support and working with investors and founders.

Benefits

 Market-rate salaries and stock options. Unlimited vacation days (mandatory 3 weeks off). Medical, dental, & vision insurance. 401(k) with company match. All-expense paid Wefunder vacation. We’ve taken three train trips across the country. Equipment of your choice. Lots of free food and drinks. Reimbursement for classes and conferences. Invites to S'more Club :)

About Wefunder



On May 16, 2016, it became legal for regular people to invest as little as $100 in startups and small businesses. Since then, we have become the largest equity crowdfunding platform. We've helped hundreds of startups and small businesses – including flying cars, space rockets, breweries, Hollywood studios, and potential Ebola cures – raise millions of dollars.



We're a Public Benefit Corporation with a mission to revitalize capitalism and keep the American dream alive. GDP growth is slowing. Wealth inequality is increasing. Entrepreneurship is dying across America; falling from 10.6% to 3.6% among those under 30 since 1989. We're reversing these trends by funding more deserving businesses across all of America, not solely tech startups in Silicon Valley.



Want to help? Join us! We're a team of founder types: enjoy autonomy, responsibility, the opportunity to learn, and no red tape. Just make it happen.

Office use is available to anyone who the CDC has cleared to gather safely indoors without masks or social distancing. Employees may continue working from home indefinitely. Even is a Remote-Equal company. The experience of working 100% remotely feels the same as working from the office in all of the ways that matter: camaraderie, engagement, and opportunity.



About Even: More than half of American workers live paycheck-to-paycheck. Stuck in this cycle, they collectively lose over $120 billion each year on payday loans, bank overdrafts, and fees. We’re trying to fix that by building new financial services that make it easier to plan ahead, pay down debt, and save. And we’re doing it as a transparent, straightforward business that only profits when our members do. Learn more



The Role: Software Engineers at Even build the products & systems that serve our members and run our company. Besides writing, reviewing, and shipping code, engineers collaborate with others across the company, from product, design, and data to sales, compliance, and customer support. Software Engineers at Even are highly technical, communicative and emotionally intelligent.



Tools We Use: You absolutely do not need experience with all of these, but we thought you might be curious. Tools can be learned, so we care much more about your general engineering skill than knowledge of a particular language/tool/technology.

 Server: Go, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS (S3, SQS, etc.) Client: React Native (JavaScript, iOS, Android), GraphQL, Relay Infra: Bazel, Docker, Redshift

What you'll do:

 Lead and contribute to projects. You will lead projects from start to finish and understand the impact (both process and business) of your technical decisions. You love to code and don’t want to be out of the weeds. Bring technical experience. You have meaningful experience building, shipping — and growing — non-trivial products & services and can guide through learned experiences. Share technical expertise. You love to mentor other engineers and help them understand complex technical problems and concepts. Keeping knowledge to yourself isn’t fun for you, you love watching others learn and grow. Build and maintain documentation. As a growing and remote organization, having the necessary docs are key to our success. Solve complex problems that arise from our unique domain. We deal with real-world money movement, sensitive financial data at scale, and are creating novel financial mechanics with no real precedent. We also operate in a large codebase (currently, >500k LOC).

What you'll need:

 Expertise in some part of the stack, and a broad understanding of the rest. Passion for your craft, people and our mission. You value quality across code, communication, and culture. Understanding of how to operate in the unknown. Even is a growing company that doesn’t have it all figured out just yet. You’ll be successful here if you thrive in environments where the directions aren’t laid out for you. A desire to keep growing your skills, and an ability to learn quickly; you never stop learning. We hire for slope, not just y-intercept.

What you'll get from us:

 The chance to work on a serious problem that affects more than half the U.S. population. A culture that gives you the time and space required to build great things. Competitive compensation, equity, and healthcare packages. 401(k) with 50% match from Even on up to 6% of your salary. A $5,000 annual educational stipend to invest in your learning and development. A $500 annual stipend to use towards personal financial advice. A $100 monthly stipend for health and wellness expenses. A 5-year exercise window on stock options after 2 years at Even. A flexible vacation policy and a team that understands building a company is a marathon, not a sprint. 3 months bonding leave for both birthing and non-birthing parents. An additional 1.5 months of fully paid leave for pregnancy disability. A culture that gives you the autonomy you need to do great work, and the transparency you need to make good decisions.

Why Cisco



#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.



We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!



But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)



Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Why Cisco



#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.



We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!



But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)



Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.)

Our software engineers are the gurus behind the scenes ensuring all of our programs are easy to use and bug free. Using a keen eye, you’ll develop software and tools in support of many of our high-impact technology platforms such as operating systems, networks, databases and more. While we’re growing in the software business, you’ll still need to see the big picture and watch for hardware compatibility while potentially influencing design.



Who You’ll Work With



Our hardworking team members are busy programming magic across the globe on teams such as Engineering, Information Technology, Supply Chain, Customer Experience, Security and Trust, etc.



You would play a crucial role in driving next-gen software innovations including cloud, mobile, desktop or security spaces. On any of these teams, you'll get hands-on experience working with applications that make technology accessible no matter the device . See the possibilities when creativity meets design and build solutions which will transform how we work, live, learn, and play.



Who You Are



Pursuing a PhD degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or related program



Up-to-date on programming and scripting languages; both front end and back end C/C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, and Ruby



Knowledge of Linux, Networking concepts, OS fundamentals, Embedded Development, and/or ML



Hands on QA, Testing, and/or Debugging skills



Experience with Databases, Web Application Development, Web Services, and API Development



Why Cisco



#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.



We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!



But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)



Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.



So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",""

Why Cisco



#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.



We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!



But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)



Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.



So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",""

Why Cisco



#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.



We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!



But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)



Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.



So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!",""

The name ThousandEyes was born from two big ideas the power to see things not ordinarily possible and the ability to collect insights from a multitude of vantage points. As organizations rely more on cloud services and the Internet, the network has become a black box they can't understand. Our Internet and cloud intelligence platform delivers the only collectively powered view of the Internet, cloud and SaaS platforms, helping enterprises and service providers work together to identify problems before it impacts revenue, damages brand reputation, or halts employee productivity.



In August 2020, Cisco Systems completed the acquisition of ThousandEyes, which now forms the ThousandEyes Business Unit within Cisco’s Network Services Business Group, and is a foundational component of Cisco’s growing Observability business.
